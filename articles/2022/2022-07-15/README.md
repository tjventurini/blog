Here are the Newsletters you can't afford to miss as a Laravel developer.

<!-- more -->

The following two newsletters are my main source of information on the Laravel framework and I can highly recommend them to all Laravel developers.

## Laravel News

Laravel News is the official blog of Laravel. Every day bringing you the latest news, tutorials, and packages for the framework.

* [Laravel News](https://laravel-news.com)

## Freek.dev Newsletter

If you have spent some time in the Laravel community, then you for sure have red or used a [spatie.be](https://spatie.be) package. The public figure of spatie.be is Freek van der Herten. Not only does he and his team provide great Laravel packages and courses, but he also has one of the best Newsletters for web developers out there.

> Also his domain is **freek.dev** - how awesome is that! ðŸ˜±

And that's it for now. But I might update this list at a later point ðŸ¤“
