I spend a lot of time on twitter recently. And it is really awesome to see so much people sharing tips and tutorials over there. Recently I learned how to use the CSS grayscale filter over there ðŸ¤“

<!-- more -->

## Using `filter: grayscale()`

The basic usage is simple: `grayscale(amount)`

```css
filter: grayscale(0); /* no grayscale */
filter: grayscale(0.20); /* going grayish */
filter: grayscale(60%); /* going further */
filter: grayscale(1); /* no more colors! */
```

You can play around with it using the example on [developers.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/grayscale)! ðŸŽ®
