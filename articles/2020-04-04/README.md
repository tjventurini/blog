Welcome traveler of the world wide web and welcome to my new website! If you have been here before, then you might have noticed that I changed a lot and reduced the design to a minimum. Let me give you a quick tour on what was changed and why 😁

## Vuepress instead of a CMS

As I have already a lot of experience in using content management systems as [Modx](https://modx.com), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) and a couple of self built ones, based on [Laravel](https://laravel) and some admin panel like [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com), [Backpack](https://backpackforlaravel.com/) and (my new favorite 🌟) [Voyager](https://voyager.devdojo.com/), I decided to go with something more simple this time: [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.com).

## Vue

Doing something in the frontend again turned out to be a lot of fun. Although I have spent most of the time playing with the mechanics of vue and vuepress and did not so much of actual design - as you can clearly see 😉

## Markdown

Because of the nature of vuepress every article I write from now on will be saved as a markdown file - what I love! 😍 Simply because now everything is part of the [git repository](https://github.com/tjventurini/blog) and doesn't need to have a database in the background. So no long setup or anything alike. I just run ...

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tjventurini/blog.git
yarn install
npm run dev
```

... and that's it, I'm already all set to write a new article.

This is super handy because I like to play a lot with the code on my local machines and since I am around with heavy tools ⚒ sometimes, it can happen that I mess up a lot. But thats okey, no client projects involved so everything good 😉 Anyways, I want to setup my blog every time that happens. So in short, this setup makes it way more easy to keep my blog going in the long run.

## A new Playground

As you probably guessed already, my blog has (once again) become a playground for me to play around with vue and everything related to it. I love this opportunities, such as creating this blog, because they enable you to revisit the fun and joy that I had when I started coding.

## The Perfect Day 2020/04/04 - 404

Today we have the 4th of April which is the day of the developers and the entire internet. What a nice day to go online with my new blog 😁
