How to install NeoVim 0.5 in Ubuntu. Short and uncomplicated.

<!-- more -->

[NeoVim](https://neovim.io) 0.5 can be installed using the neovim-ppa.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install neovim
```

Next you should create a custom `vimrc` file for it - see `:help nvim-from-vim`.

It will tell you that you should execute (`:`) the following from within `nvim`.

```
:call mkdir(stdpath('config'), 'p')
:exe 'edit '.stdpath('config').'/init.vim'
```

Then copy in the following piece of code, which will ensure that your normal `.vimrc` file is loaded. So you don't have to manage that second configuration except it really is a `nvim` specific configuration.

```
set runtimepath^=~/.vim runtimepath+=~/.vim/after
let &packpath = &runtimepath
source ~/.vimrc
```

This file will be located under `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`.

If you are lazy (like me) you can add `nvim` as `vim` alternative.

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install $(which vim) vim $(which nvim) 10
```

Now you can call the following to choose `nvim` as alternative to `vim` so whenever you call `vim` in the terminal it actually starts `nvim`.

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config vim
```

Select `nvim` through the number in the first column.

And that's it. Have fun with it üòÅ
