In this post I'm gonna collect some useful resources in order to learn and play with regular expressions. 

<!-- more -->

Because I once again updated the [Regular Expressions in PHP](../../2020/2020-05-04/README.md) article in order to extend the list of tools and resources, I decided to dedicate a full post to these. So in the future I will just update this list of resources.

## Resources
