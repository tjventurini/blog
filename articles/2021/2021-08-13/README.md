So for some reason you can isolate workspaces in the gnome configuration of ubuntu, but you can't isolate the app switcher to do the same ... Let's fix that! üòé

Open a terminal and execute the following. This will set the option `current-workspace-only` to `true` on the app-switcher configuration.

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.app-switcher current-workspace-only true
```

And that's it! üòÅ
