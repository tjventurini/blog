This one is quick and easy. Let's do it! 😁

<!-- more -->

First, head over to your wordpress admin panel. Go to the plugins section and search for [Google Site Kit](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-site-kit/) and install it.

Then activate it and click on the _Start Setup_ button prompted to you. This will walk you through a short process, after your site should be setup with google analytics.

There will be a new _Site Kit_ menu item available in your wordpress admin panel.

And that's it! 👍
