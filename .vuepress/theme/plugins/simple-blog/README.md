# VuePress Plugin Schedule

Schedule the posts of your blog with a cronjob.

## Features

* Adds `publish` attribute to your pages, based on the `date attribute`.

## Install

TODO: publish on composer

## Setup

TODO: write basic setup

### Config

TODO: write config options

### Cornjob

Setup a cronjob on your server that rebuilds the page once a day. I suggest that you run the job at midnight.

`npm run build`
